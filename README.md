# QuickPic (Fork) — Tools For Pictures

Hey! If this looks like Theo’s QuickPic (https://quickpic.t3.gg/), you’re right.
This is a fork of the original repo: https://github.com/t3dotgg/quickpic

I forked it to add one extra thing I really wanted:
- Fetch SVGs directly from a URL and convert to PNG (no manual download needed)

Everything else is kept as close to the original as possible. All credit for the base
app goes to Theo — I just added remote file conversion on top.
